						Ziplly, was a product of an unfortunate flat tire,
						lonely ponderings and a bit of hard work to give life to an unborn
						idea.
						One fine Seattle day, I tried to pull my car out of the
						street in
						front of our
						house and noticed I had a flat tire. When I
						started to fix the flat, I
						realized

						I didn't have the right tools.
						Fortunately, one of my neighbors
						noticed me

						struggling and stepped
						in, lending me his time and tools. This got me

						wondering how can I
						get quick help if I were caught in a
						similar

						situation in the
						future.

						Lets say you needed to borrow something such as a ladder
						or tools to
						fix

						a leek, but you didn’t want to go buy them since you
						had no storage
						space

						to keep them. Or perhaps you witnessed one of
						your neighbors cars
						get hit

						and the offender didn’t stop or leave a
						note. There are many
						situations

						where we could use the help of our
						neighbors, need to borrow an item we

						don’t have, or have
						information that we should share with other
						members

						of our
						community. Ziplly is a private and secure community forum dedicated at
						connecting neighbors to be more neighborly.

					</p>
					<p class="{style.text}">
						Knowing your neighbors is great, but Zipply is even
						better!. Ziplly knows

						that communities thrive on local businesses
						and we aim to connect

						members of the community directly with the
						stores, restaurants and
						various

						shops with their best customers -
						the people who live right next door.

						Through Ziplly, businesses can
						share deals and promotions in real
						time,

						gather meaningful feedback
						from consumers, and truly connect with their

						primary customers.
					</p>
					<p class="{style.text}">
						Ziplly is a platform which ties communities together
						through promoting

						communication and raising awareness about local
						issues that
						matter.

						One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a
						convenience
						feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to
						tell the
						Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For
						example,
						if you personalize Ziplly pages, or register with Ziplly
						site or
						services, a cookie helps Ziplly to recall your specific
						information
						on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of
						recording your
						personal information, such as billing addresses,
						shipping
						addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Ziplly
						website,
						the information you previously provided can be retrieved,
						so you
						can easily use the Ziplly features that you customized.
					</p>
					<p>
						You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web
						browsers
						automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify
						your
						browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you
						choose to
						decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience
						the
						interactive features of the Ziplly services or websites you
						visit.
